# Population Lines: Philadelphia

I adapted code from James Cheshire's [Population Lines project](https://spatial.ly/2017/04/population-lines-how-and-why-i-created-it/) to make a population lines figure for Philadelphia. The code uses the tidycensus package to interface with the US Census API to download population data.
